        <div class="md_heading">The State of Unemployment in Nigeria</div>
        <div class="article_text">
          <p>
            The dire unemployment situation in Nigeria is worrisome. Many
            graduates in the country continue to face challenges with finding
            employment and this is a widespread concern. The International
            Labour Organisation (ILO) has linked unemployment in Nigeria to the
            phenomenon of a jobless growth economy, increased number of school
            graduates with no matching job opportunities, a moratorium on
            employment in many public and private sector institutions, and
            continued job losses in several sectors within the country.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is without doubt that Nigeria has experienced a sustained period
            of economic growth in the last decade but this is without a
            corresponding improvement in employment. Over 42% of Nigerian youth
            remain unemployed and a larger percentage are underemployed. This
            figure was projected to further increase in 2022 particularly with
            the youth unemployment rate taking the chunk of that with 50% and
            this comes to about 25-30m Nigerian youth.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The depth of Nigeria’s unemployment crisis is particularly evident
            amongst Nigerian youth with about 2 in 5 youths between the ages of
            15 and 35 affected and unemployed. With an economy just exiting
            recession and grappling with sustainable economic growth, tackling
            youth unemployment is an urgent imperative and validates our ethos
            at EnterpriseNGR.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are many interventions both public and private sectors driven-
            some of which are disruptive with the use of technology. Most of
            these are all targeted at solving this problem through
            entrepreneurship. So many funding opportunities, capacity building
            trainings, entrepreneurship support, consulting, advisory and many
            more that are targeted at enterprise development but only a few
            focusing on employability and internship placements for our young
            and vibrant youth who are either employable but not employed or can
            be upskilled and prepped to become employable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            EnterpriseNGR has identified employability and unemployment issues
            as one that will come back to bite us all if it’s not looked into
            and nipped in the bud early enough. This constitutes part of the
            reason why we are heavily invested in supporting young Nigerians to
            make meaning of their lives through employability channels. Our
            graduates constantly face long- term unemployment or underemployment
            challenges due to various factors including the increasing demand
            from the workplace. They will be unable to find work until they
            obtain the relevant skills that are in high demand within the
            ecosystem and the future of work.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Furthermore, there is the need for the redesign of our tertiary
            institution curricular such that they are more robust and inclusive
            with content closing the skills gap that our potential employees do
            not have. By gaining these skills, they become relevant and
            attractive to employers, employable and better positioned for job
            opportunities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is the need to sensitize and create awareness of the skills
            for the future and this can be done through programmes and
            interventions from the university level with the aim of resetting
            the mindsets of our youth even before they graduate.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is the need for employers to shift their focus from people who
            are already employed to people who are not employed, upskill them to
            close the skills gap and then give them the opportunity to work. We
            can find them within Universities, Nigerian Youth Service Corp and
            just out of the Nigerian Youth Service Corp. This is infact where
            the gap is. There is need for them to closely partner with such
            organizations as EnterpriseNGR to assess their employment gaps,
            project their employment needs over the next 5 to 10 years, and to
            map an employment road map to fill this gap so they can meet their
            growth plans now and in the future.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As with many other countries around the world, COVID-19 had a
            significant impact on Nigeria’s population and the structure of work
            and career advancement and so now more than ever, the urgency for
            the adoption of workable strategies that produce future ready
            employees (employable youth) is pertinent given the burgeoning
            youthful population of the country.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At EnterpriseNGR, we are building a network of growth companies and
            a community of highly employable Nigerian youth equipped with the
            skills for the future and prepped up for the future of work!
