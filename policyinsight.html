          <p>
            There is growing attention on Environmental, Social and Governance,
            or ESG for short, around the globe, just as various stakeholders,
            including investors, companies, regulatory bodies, consumers, and
            most especially governments have intensified campaigns on matters
            related to ESG in recent times. The intensification of these
            campaigns is largely influenced by diverse socio-economic and
            political challenges confronting the business world.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In this edition of EnterpriseNGR Policy Insights, we briefly examine
            the emerging issues that are shifting the trend of the ESG
            campaigns, why companies need to move fast ahead of regulation, and
            how they can unlock this process to get into the game.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Three pillars of ESG shine a spotlight on areas companies can
            include in their people- and community-focused agenda. The
            environmental pillar is concerned with how companies’ activities
            impact the environment. Such impact transcends internal operations
            to include activities across the entire value chain and spans
            particular areas of energy efficiencies, carbon footprints,
            pollution alleviation, waste management, and water usage. Companies
            that neglect this aspect of the ESG may have to bear the consequence
            at some point in the business lifecycle.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The social pillar emphasizes people. The big question for business
            leaders is how decisions and policies the company makes affect its
            business ethics, human rights practices, gender diversity, and other
            social consequences. Companies’ dealings with suppliers, customers,
            investors, employees, and the communities where they operate are
            gauged and adjudged by a set of acceptable societal values at any
            given time. And, if there is one thing COVID-19 underscores, it is
            the importance of the social pillar. The governance pillar centres
            on leadership and sustainability, the superset of significantly
            important factors that include board structure, internal control and
            compliance, executive compensation, and extends even to the less
            popular areas of organizational politics and lobbying.

          <p>
            ESG is attracting growing recognition, especially in the financial
            services sector. Enormous campaigns on Sustainable Development Goals
            (SDGs) are nudging businesses to consider integrating ESG in their
            practices. With the rise in sustainable finance, global companies
            are integrating ESG propositions in their company statement,
            mission, and vision, and ultimately building a business model that
            addresses ESG risks. For instance, over 500 funds were repurposed in
            Europe in 2021, according to Reuters. Increasing numbers of
            investors seek to achieve a positive ESG outcome along with
            financial returns on investments. The 2021 global survey data by BNP
            Paribas report 61 per cent of investors that implore their company
            to adopt ESG mandates. In Nigeria, in 2021, FMDQ Securities Exchange
            Limited launched Africa’s first green exchange, FMDQ Green Exchange,
            which is a platform dedicated to promote the advancement of Green
            and Sustainable Finance, and transparency of data on Environmental,
            Social and Governance (ESG) in the financial markets. Recent trends
            in data show that equity funds with social or ESG mandates are
            attracting more funding than those without these mandates.
            Increasingly, asset managers are including ESG measures in
            investment criteria and closely monitoring ESG ratings to evaluate
            investment decisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Globally there are no unified standards and guidelines to reporting
            ESG practices and in many jurisdictions, ESG disclosure, as a
            requirement, is not yet an affirmative duty. To date, not all
            companies are mandated to report ESG practices but with the ongoing
            trend, they will likely be required to do so. There is rising
            speculation that the International Financial Reporting Standards
            (IFRS) Foundation will soon release guidelines and standards
            mandating sustainability reporting. In addition, countries that
            assented to the COP21 Nationally Determined Contributions, which
            represent each country's commitments to “reduce greenhouse gas
            emissions and adapt to climate change”, and nations that committed
            to the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact, including Nigeria, if they will
            fulfill their commitments, will ultimately require that businesses
            operate within the parameter of a set of national policies. Yes,
            regulators in the financial and professional services sector are
            already pushing boundaries for companies to embrace sustainable
            practices, but much of the current regulatory tools are
            moral-suasion.
          </p>
          <br />

          <ol>
            <li>
              Determine the organisation’s ESG priority areas:
              <br />
              Defining ESG propositions opens up questions that will enable the
              organisation to dissect and filter the particular areas of
              environmental, social, and governance interests that align with
              its mission and vision.
            </li>

            <li>
              Develop ESG metrics:
              <br />
              Eventually, organisations will need to develop metrics on
              identified key ESG factors and firm up tools to collect, mine and
              monitor data on a regular basis. This step requires adequate
              planning and extensive resources, including the input and
              participation of both internal and external stakeholders. Where
              organisations do not have in-house data capability, finding the
              right partners to offer support and guidance works perfectly as
              well. Consultations with customers, suppliers, investors, and
              other ecosystem stakeholders to find correct answers and
              understand priorities and expectations, are a similarly important
              requirement.
            </li>

            <li>
              Incorporate ESG in value-creation activities:
              <br />
              Value-creation activities demand a focus on the company’s
              sustainability agenda. Activities directly linked to profits and
              performance deserve a place on the sustainability watch list.
              Corporate governance, executive compensation, stakeholder
              engagement, energy efficiencies, waste management, and carbon
              footprints should be approached in similar ways the organization
              will approach any growth-driven programmes and “strategic business
              opportunities”.
            </li>

            <li>
              Promote employee engagement:
              <br />
              Company-wide ESG practices that engage employees across different
              units are more powerful than those limited to the sustainability
              unit of the organisation. Corporate culture and values are areas
              organisations will engage employees to integrate ESG practices for
              a corporate transformational shift. Also, employees across
              business functions need to understand how to incorporate
              sustainable practices in varied business activities.
            </li>

            <li>
              Facilitate continous customer engagement:
              <br />
              For the organisation to understand customers’ ESG expectations,
              significant effort will be required in clarifying those
              expectations on a regular basis and how they can be achieved from
              customers’ viewpoints. At the product/service design or
              development stage, the approach should be to develop products with
              customers ‒ not for customers: spend time to understand their
              value journey and adapt value proposition accordingly. Beyond
              that, the product packaging and delivery process, as well as
              marketing effort, should create awareness and emphasize how
              products or services align with customer ESG expectations.
            </li>

            <li>
              Collaborate with product partners, suppliers and distributors:
              <br />
              Companies require strong collaborations across forces for ESG to
              take a firm place. A bunch of an organisation’s ESG activities
              transcends the wider sphere of external stakeholders, suppliers,
              distributors and other partners. The activities and practices of
              each stakeholder group may significantly alter final products at
              the last mile. Understanding the company’s ESG priorities can
              shape partners’ business models in order to conform with those
              priorities. Partners’ choices among types of raw materials,
              delivery mechanisms, channels, and locations (onsite and offsite),
              need to be evaluated and positioned to deliver ESG goals for the
              organisation.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            ESG is never a silver bullet for turning businesses into a
            spontaneous profit-generating venture. At the early stages,
            organisations should not expect major turnarounds; capital outlays
            devoted to ESG practices may bite deep into profits. However, once a
            good foundation is laid and the entire ESG strategy is
            well-positioned, adoption of ESG practices could become an adventure
            that will lift enterprise value.
