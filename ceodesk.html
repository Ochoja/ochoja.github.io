          <p>
            I want to take this opportunity to reflect on the EnterpriseNGR
            journey since our launch in October 2021. It has been a superb start
            for us as we embark on our mission to make Nigeria the premier
            financial services centre in Africa.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our launch event tagged, <strong>the Voices of Enterprise</strong> ,
            was a huge success with high-level speakers including amongst others
            the Vice President of Nigeria, the globally acclaimed investment and
            finance guru, Bayo Ogunlesi, our friends from Enterprise Singapore,
            and TheCityUK – two organisations we seek to model. Attendance at
            the virtual event was phenomenal and the discourse was at peak
            levels. That was indeed our big bang moment and a great start.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Welcome to Our New Members</h3>
          <p>
            Following our official launch, we have focused on strengthening our
            organisational structures and expanding our membership base. I'm
            delighted to report that we have increased our membership base by
            50% since our official launch. I wish acknowledge our new Founding
            Members: DLM Capital Group, Investment One Financial Services
            Limited and Custodian Investment Plc. who by this membership have
            made a lifelong commitment towards building the Nigerian financial
            and professional services ecosystem.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also thank our new Gold subscription members who include the Bank
            of Industry of Nigeria, First Ally Capital Limited, and Polaris
            Bank. We are truly encouraged by your support. Recognition also goes
            out to our new Silver and Bronze members – we appreciate you all.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>New Partnerships</h3>
          <p>
            In creating a strong internal structure, we have focused on
            entrenching global best practices by engaging like-minded
            international organisations. I am pleased to note that we have
            entered a knowledge-sharing arrangement with TheCityUK, the leading
            advocacy group in the United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We attended the Kenya Fintech Forum an event organized by the
            Nairobi International Financial Centre Authority (NIFCA) and
            TheCityUK. It is the flagship event of the collaborative NIFCA /
            TheCityUK Fintech Project. We were invited to attend by TheCityUK
            with a view to explore similar collaborations for Nigeria. The event
            was eye opening and we are poised to support the Fintech revolution
            in Nigeria.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            TheCityUK also graciously introduced us to the World Alliance of
            International Financial Centers (WAIFC) and has agreed to support
            our bid to become an Observer at the organisation as a prelude to
            seeking full membership.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            WAIFC is a non-profit association registered in Brussels, Belgium.
            It represents leading international financial centers and
            facilitates cooperation and the exchange of best practices. WAIFC
            members are city governments, associations, and institutions similar
            to ours developing and promoting their financial centers. WAIFC
            presently has 20 Members across all the continents of the world.
            Member organisations include TheCityUK, Paris Europlace, Qatar
            Financial Centre, Dubai International Financial Centre Authority,
            Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council, FinCity.Tokyo,
            Toronto Finance International, Casablanca Finance City and Rwanda
            Finance Limited among others.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We attended the WAIFC Panel and observed their Board Meeting held in
            Kigali, Rwanda. The event presented us with a unique opportunity to
            network and associate with members of WAIFC who were all pleased
            that Nigeria is ready to take its rightful place in the committee of
            nations. WAIFC would like to see the development of more
            international finance centers on the African continent and are very
            keen to support us.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These partnerships are aimed at shortening our learning curve while
            ensuring we start achieving positive impact in no time.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Continuing our Advocacy Work</h3>
          <p>
            With respect to our advocacy work we have identified data as a key
            factor for analysing the issues affecting the sector and the country
            at large. We had a meeting with the Statistician General of the
            Federal Republic of Nigeria and we are working on Terms of Reference
            for a partnership to generate accurate and granulated data for the
            Financial and Professional Services sector to support. optimal
            policy formulation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am excited to note that we are currently putting finishing touches
            to our very first research output, the State of Enterprise report
            which will be officially launched in Q2 of 2022. The report will
            spotlight the sector and showcase baseline statistics with a view to
            highlight the importance of the sector and also serve as a basis to
            measure our performance against agreed indices.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am also particularly delighted to report on our progress regarding
            our first direct intervention tagged, the Youth of Enterprise (YOE).
            This initiative is focused on onboarding 5,000 youth annually with a
            view to upskill and place them in 6 months paid internships with our
            partner organisations. The initiative will officially go live in Q2
            of 2022, and we remain confident that the impact YOE will have on
            the Nigerian economy will be far-reaching.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>The Future is Bright</h3>
          <p>
            Though it is still early days for us at EnterpriseNGR, I dare say,
            the dream is truly coming to life and we are well on the path to
            laying a solid foundation towards achieving our lofty goals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I do hope you enjoy this first instalment of our quarterly
            newsletter and I enjoin you all to join hands with us to build the
            FPS sector and Nigeria at large.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thank you,
            <br />
            <br />
            Obi Ibekwe
            <br />
